Note:

We were not able to complete the backend (server side) of our web app,
so we included a SQL file in the "sql" folder called 
WebAppQueries.sql. This includes all the queries that we would have 
potentially incorporated into our server side. 
However, we did complete the frontend/UI portion of the web app.
